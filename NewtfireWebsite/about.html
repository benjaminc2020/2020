             <p>Bio</p> <p2>Benjamin Crawford was born in Pittsburgh, PA. Currently he is in his last semester of his undergrad career at the University of Pittsburgh in Greensburg. Benjamin is fascinated with anything technology. From server racks, to cameras, to digital turntables. When he's not busy, he enjoys the outdoors and anything he can balance his feet on, like a longboard or a snowboard. As a final note, he likes to think writing in the third person will do a better job at intriguing the reader.</p2>
